# locale-root-url

A dummy app that shows how one might prefix their app with a locale without it interfering with Ember's router.

Basically, `http://foo.com/fr/` (nuance, trailing slash required) and `http://foo.com/` go to the same index route but preloads app payload with default translations.  

English by default.  *NOTE: Passing `/en/` will also work as expected.*  The source of truth for what locales are supported are the translation files themselves.  The translation files are stored in YAML format outside of `app` (very important and intentional to avoid bundling in app.js).
